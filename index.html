       Music therapy is non-pharmaceutical medical treatment that uses the different aspects of music to help treat different types of 
       mental disorders. 
        
       Music can trigger brain and muscle signals. We can record these by using a variety of devices
       such as EEGs, EMGs and more. Researchers tend to look for patterns in a patient’s behaviour e.g., elevated heart rate / sounds, EEG
       recordings etc. If researchers collaborate on their findings, they may see trends in different groups of patients. 
        
       From these recordings, researchers can make out which components of music evoke certain signals to see whether they can be replicated
       through technology and engineering to help the patient feel the same feeling. For instance, technology such as artifical intelligence 
       is capable of generating music that can aim to reduce stress levels for an individual.
        
       This is particularly useful when treating mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder as you see which 
       melodies / rhythms trigger positive emotions and then attempt to reproduce this.

      Music therapy is the non-pharmaceutical treatment of illnesses, diseases and disorders.  Music can access prefrontal, limbic and 
      sensory pathways. This then triggers dopamine receptors as well as stress-related hormone responses, which can affect mood and cognitive function.

      It is able to target fields like emotional development or cognitive development. So, the therapy process and devices involved are dependent on 
      what you want to treat. For example, if a therapist wanted to focus on speech and language development, they’d be looking at lyrics, rhythmic 
      movement analysis, percussive instruments and their timbres and more <a href = https://pubs-aip-org.surrey.idm.oclc.org/aip/acp/article/2878/1/020023/2924800/Music-therapy-for-hearing-impaired-Measuring>(Das, Gupta and Neogi, 2023).</a>

      <h5><b> What devices are used? </b></h5>
      Devices have been engineered to obtain results which are useful for various areas in music therapy. 
      A common device used is an electroencephalogram (EEG), which is used to record brain activity and its signals when performing different tasks. 
      It is made up of electrodes that are embedded into a silicon cap. This is placed on the patient’s head to detect charges from brain cells, which 
      produce a brain wave pattern. From there, they are interpreted to help diagnose conditions like narcolepsy <a href= https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv>(Cleveland Clinic, 2021)</a>.
    
      As technology develops, scientists are trying to develop more causal devices to take recordings. For example, smart watches can be used
      to take someone’s pulse, and heart rate variability (HRV). HRV can be used to gage how well the body can adapt to stress and recovering
      from it <a href = https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv>(Cleveland Clinic, 2021)</a>. A low HRV would suggest that someone responds worse to stress, hence it being common amongst people with
      anxiety. Research has shown that music can divert a patient’s attention from negative emotions. This would stimulate auditory receptors due
      to less activity in the sympathetic nervous system, also known as the “fight or flight” system <a href = https://doi.org/10.6001/actamedica.v25i2.3763>(Kučikienė and Praninskienė, 2018)</a>.
      
      For physical activity, devices such as an Electromyography (EMG) are used for detecting electrical signals in muscles. A needle-like electrode
      is put into a muscle, and electrical signals are recorded when the person is at rest and moving. These can be used to see if the nerves are
      functioning properly and if not, it can indicate diseases such as carpal tunnel, peripheral neuropathy (an issue with the nerves that send
      signals to the brain and spine and rest of the body) and more. In music therapy, they can produce biofeedback for rehabilitation. 

      Essentially, a patient will have an EMG connected to them and the data from the session will be put into augmented reality (AR). This will be used
      to produce a rhythm so that the patient can easily understand where they have gone wrong or right when doing certain movements. For instance,
      if the focus is helping the patient, who’s recovering from stroke, open and close their hand properly the rhythm will be louder / at a higher
      pitch when they’ve used too much pressure or raised the shoulder too high. Music tends to be easier to interpret, so the patient should be able
      to easily adjust their muscle movements based off the tune <a href= https://doi.org/10.1109/robio.2011.6181738>(Boonyarat Viriyasaksathian et al., 2011)>.</a>
      <h5><b> How is AI used in music therapy?</b></h5> <!----------------------------POINT 3------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
      Throughout this essay, there has been a common theme of recognising patterns. This is where AI and machine learning can become extremely useful. 
      Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology programmed to solve problems and learn in a human-like manner. To train AI, it’s given large,
      relevant amounts of data to process repeatedly to learn from, whilst using the algorithms it’s been programmed with. This is known as
      machine learning, and it is how AI-generated music in this field is produced. 

      Although, recognising patterns is machine learning’s forte, predictions based off these data may be more advantageous for researchers.
      Data mining does exactly that, as it interprets data, finds uncommon trends, then uses this to make predictions for future outcomes.
      This can save time as opposed to doing numerous sessions to obtain data from patients, from which crucial trends could be missed by
      researchers. 
      <h5><b>How is it used when researching certain illnesses?</b></h5><!-------------------------------- POINT 4-------------------------------------------------------->
      Currently, there are a plethora of music therapy methods which have successfully integrated AI and engineering. 

      Apps for mental health illnesses such as anxiety heavily rely on this technology. The user’s real-time data e.g. HRV levels can be obtained
      through smartwatchesand then used by AI to then recommend music that has proven to lower their levels of anxiety. Through machine learning and
      using virtual reality to stimulate emotions in potential situations, it may be possible to pre-emptively recognise what environments may cause
      certain levels of stress and which songs are best for managing this.

      Music therapy showed results in comatose patients that suffered major brain injuries. From an EEG reading, you get different brain wave
      frequencies as shown in Table 1.
      <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Type of Wave</th>
        <th>Frequency Range (Hz)</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Delta</td>
        <td>1-4</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Theta</td>
        <td>4-8</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Alpha 1</td>
        <td>8-10</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Alpha 2</td>
        <td>11-13</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Beta</td>
        <td>Greater than 13</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Gamma</td>
        <td>30-40</td>
      </tr>
      
    </table>
Table 1: Brain waves and their frequencies <a href = https://doi.org/10.6001/actamedica.v25i2.3763>(Kučikienė and Praninskienė, 2018)</a>. 
      
      Higher frequency waves show a higher level of brain activity and vice versa. Music has proven to increase brain
      activity as EEG readings have shown a spike in alpha and beta waves in patients when music was played <a href = https://doi.org/10.6001/actamedica.v25i2.3763>(Kučikienė and Praninskienė, 2018)</a>.

      Although these advancements have their advantages, some may argue that the sheer data use is invasive. Frequent monitorisation may cause
      discomfort for some patients. Furthermore, certain devices such as smartwatches will cause financial barriers. This could result in the
      health of some to be disregarded, which raises ethical concerns. Therefore, as technology improves, it is important to ensure that it
      remains accessible for all.
      <h5><b>Conclusion</b></h5>
      To conclude, this essay has explained the different devices used in music therapy to obtain results and how varied this field is. It can help
      manage illnesses and diseases from anxiety to stroke rehabilitation. In addition, AI is rapidly improving. It is already being used to reveal
      complex trends. It also plays a crucial role in producing the music and in the future, should be even better at doing so.
